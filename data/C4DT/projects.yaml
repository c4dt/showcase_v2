    description: Research techniques to improve privacy when using electronic identities
    tech_desc: >
      Today's identity security faces challenges like misuse and tracking. Our goal is to enable secure,
      anonymous, unlinkable E-ID interactions by researching novel cryptographic algorithms. This boosts
      user trust, creates new business opportunities, and cuts financial losses after data breaches.

    description: Combating phishing through vulnerability analysis, detection tools, and best practice guidelines.
    tech_desc: >
      This project addresses phishing threats through the analysis of existing
      countermeasures, identification of vulnerabilities, and development of
      innovative solutions including best practice guidelines and tools for
      email configuration testing and malicious link detection.
      The initiative enhances organizational and societal resilience against
      phishing attacks through knowledge dissemination and fosters collaboration
      among stakeholders.
    layman_desc: >
      This project tackles phishing—a common online scam where criminals trick
      people into clicking dangerous links or sharing personal information through
      deceptive emails.
      It develops practical guides and easy-to-use tools to help individuals and
      organizations recognize and protect themselves against these attacks.

    description: Securing industrial HMI software for EU Cyber-Resilience-Act compliance
    tech_desc: >
      This project integrates state-of-the-art software security measures into
      Digiinov HMI, a platform bridging Operational Technology (OT) and Information
      Technology (IT) for industrial Human-Machine Interfaces.
      The collaboration with HEIG-VD and EPFL focuses on achieving compliance with
      the EU Cyber-Resilience-Act (CRA) requirements before its 2027 enforcement.
      The security enhancements target the software development lifecycle and
      maintenance processes for embedded industrial control systems.
    layman_desc: >
      This project enhances the security of software used to control and monitor
      industrial machines, preparing it for new European cybersecurity regulations.
      The EU's Cyber-Resilience-Act requires software products to meet strict
      security standards starting in 2027, protecting users from digital threats.
      By partnering with academic cybersecurity experts, this project ensures
      machine manufacturers can offer secure, compliant products ahead of schedule.
