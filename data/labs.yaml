      number of independent parties to allow scalable self-organizing communities. With no single trusted party, cothorities can secure
      software updates, provide public randomness, enable privacy-conscious medical-data sharing and a lot more. Other projects include
      communicating securely over insecure channels and fast, scalable, accountable anonymous communication.

      Our research aims to make sense of large amounts of data. Frequently, the data we analyze is collected on the Web, e.g., using server
      logs, social media, wikis, online news, online games, etc. We distill heaps of raw data into meaningful insights by developing and
      applying algorithms and techniques in areas including social and information network analysis, machine learning, computational social
      science, data mining, natural language processing, and human computation.

      Our research focuses on software and systems security. Despite efforts and improvements in bug discovery techniques, some exploitable
      vulnerabilities will remain. We target techniques that both enable developers to discover and remove bugs and make programs resilient
      against the exploitation of unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities.
      <ul>
        <li>
          To discover bugs we propose (i) sanitization techniques that enforce
          a security property such as memory or type safety; given concrete
          program input, our sanitizers then flag any property violations
          (ii) fuzzing techniques that leverage static and dynamic analysis to
          create program inputs to explore program areas that are not yet covered
          through existing test cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          To protect against exploitable
          vulnerabilities, we focus on control-flow integrity using specific
          language semantics, enforcing type integrity, and protecting selective
          data. Under this premise, we focus on compiler-based, runtime-based, and
          language-based protection mechanisms and security policies that increase
          the resilience of applications against attacks (in the presence of
          software vulnerabilities).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      All prototypes are released as open-source.

      Today, we experience an unprecedented integration of previously disconnected systems. Consequently, there is a leap in the complexity
      of the software controlling these systems. The challenge we are facing is how to master this complexity while at the same time
      increasing the reliability of programs. A key element for tackling that challenge will be a better understanding of software
      composition. Good techniques for software composition are the keys to scalable systems. The principal means of writing and composing
      software is a programming language. Consequently, advances in programming language design are an important factor in solutions of the
      software composition problem. This is what we work on in our group.

      The Parallel System Architecture Lab senses that information technology has undergone a major paradigm shift with sensors, embedded
      and mobile devices generating massive amounts of data to be augmented with backend cloud services for enhanced experience. Data has
      emerged as a currency for modern society. Datacenters are now the backbone of IT offering large-scale cloud services at low costs
      benefiting from and exploiting the economies of scale. With silicon efficiency scaling having dwindled since 2004 and silicon density
      scaling slowing down, future digital platforms will rely on heterogeneous logic and memory to allow for IT scalability. Meanwhile, the
      demand for large-scale cloud services has grown dramatically faster than conventional silicon scaling making IT platform scalability a
      grand challenge. Future platforms will need hand-in-hand collaboration of application domain experts and platform designers to improve
      scalability. With many online services being in-memory and the minimum communication latency between the farthest nodes in a 20MW
      datacenter being microseconds, future server platforms will go through revolutionary changes in architecture to enable seamless
      aggregation of logic and memory resources across nodes, breaking the conventional system abstraction layers.

      Computing systems that make human sense of big data are now ubiquitous. Equipped with powerful AI algorithms, they are now present in
      all aspects of our life: they drive cars, do surgery, control the lighting in your home, recommend movies and books, and are even
      about to replace banks. Beyond the AI algorithms and the availability of large volume of data, this is now possible because we
      can  scale systems to thousand, even millions of distributed entities. Yet, designing efficient distributed systems come with many
      challenges that we address in our team.  We are interested in all aspects of such large-scale distributed systems be they datacenters,

  VCA:
    name: Verification and Computer Architecture Lab
    description: >
      Our research lies at the intersection between programming languages and computer architecture.<br>
      We are interested in designing high-level hardware programming languages especially to ease hardware verification.
      We leverage interactive theorem provers to reason about hardware, leading to more scalable and compositional proofs.<br>
      We also focus on building novel hardware architectures to support fine-grained and dynamic parallel computations.

      The Very Large Scale Computing Lab (VLSC) is trying to solve some of the critical software and hardware challenges of building
      large-scale services. These services may encompass tens of geo-distributed data centers, each of which can contain tens of thousands
      of servers. Compounded by challenges of scale and distribution, services also have very high availability and responsiveness
      requirements, and they are under continual development and evolution.

      The Center for Digital Trust is an academic-industry alliance of international relevance that facilitates
      innovation in digital trust services and products.
      It brings together 15 industry partners, 38 EPFL laboratories, civil society, and policy actors to collaborate,
      share insight, and to gain early access to trust-building technologies,
      building on state-of-the-art research at EPFL and beyond.

      We work on the theoretical foundations and practical realizations of cryptographic proofs. 
      This enables checking the correctness of a computation in zero knowledge, 
      and much faster than re-running the computation. 
      These cryptographic proofs have powerful applications in the real world.

      We're a programming languages, formal methods, and systems engineering lab at EPFL, 
      led by Clément Pit-Claudel. We use (and invent!) mathematical formalisms and interactive 
      tools to explore new ways to develop computer systems.
