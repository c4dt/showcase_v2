    Besides the documentation and source code of MedCo-Explore, we also provide a way to try out this software. To do
    that just log in our <a class="epfl-a" href="https://medco.epfl.ch/demo/">live demo</a> using the correct
    credentials. We are running MedCo-Explore with 3 different data providers (clinical sites) with 8,000 patients. For
    test purposes the data is synthetically generated.
